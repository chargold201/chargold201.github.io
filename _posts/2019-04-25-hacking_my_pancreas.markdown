When I was 8 years old, I got sick. Like, really, really sick. I had been having symptoms for a couple weeks, such as nausea, extreme thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, and generally feeling like crap. One day I woke up unable to keep down even a sip of water. My mom rushed me to the doctor, who did a fingerstick blood test and sent us straight to the hospital. Within hours, I had been admitted and diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (at that time known as Juvenile Diabetes), an autoimmune disease where the immune system views insulin-producing cells in the pancreas as "enemies" and attacks them, quickly leading to a state where the body cannot use sugar in the bloodstream as energy, causing buildup in the blood.

All of a sudden, my little life was consumed by blood tests, multiple daily injections of different types of insulin, counting every gram of carbohydrate that went into my mouth in order to adjust my insulin dose properly, carefully adjusting for any additional physical activity that might lower my blood sugar... And STILL, I had to deal with unexplained highs and lows which made me feel physically sick.

As a kid, I took it all in stride, refusing to let my parents give me injections and insisting on doing everything myself. I liked the sense of control it gave me over this disease that had so rudely inserted itself into my life. As a teenager, however, I rebelled, hard. I wanted nothing but to be a normal high schooler so I neglected my diabetes, which resulted in a second hospitalization due to Diabetic Ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition caused by prolonged very-high levels of sugar in the blood without adequate insulin available to help the body use that sugar in the cells as energy (basically the same thing that was happening at my diagnosis).

Once I got older, there were two things that got me to the healthy point I am at today. One was finally accepting my diabetes as a part of who I am and deciding that I want to educate the world about it. I love having the opportunity to correct misconceptions about Type 1 Diabetes and to tell people about my personal experience. The other thing that saved me was technology.

The first diabetes tech device I got was an insulin pump. It is an incredible little machine that stores about 3 days worth of insulin and is connected to my body via plastic tubing and a small flexible cannula that is inserted under the skin. I can program it via a screen and buttons on the device itself, and it gives me a contant small drip of insulin to combat the glucose secreted by the liver throughout the day, negating my need for an injection of long-acting insulin every day. I can also give myself a "bolus", or burst of insulin, if I eat some carbohydrates or to correct a high blood sugar. This means I don't have to give myself yet another injection at those times of day. I can fine-tune my insulin delivery in a way I never thought possible before.

The second device that changed everything for me was the CGM, or continuous glucose monitor. This consists of a thin sensor probe which is inserted under the skin, a small transmitter that attaches to the sensor and sticks to the skin, and a reciever which displays my blood sugar. ALL THE TIME. This means no more finger sticks, except twice a day to calibrate. It also beeps to alert me when my blood sugar is going high or low, so I can treat it to get it in range as quickly as possible.

Recently, thanks to Twitter and the DOC, or Diabetic Online Community, I came across the hashtags #wearenotwaiting and #openaps. This movement consists of type 1 diabetics, and the parents of type 1 diabetic children who do not want to wait for big pharma and the FDA to come up with and approve better technology to treat this disease. There are developers out there who are literally hacking their diabetes tech devices, writing open-source code to create a closed-loop APS (Artificial Pancreas System) where the insulin pump and CGM can speak to each other and adjust insulin delivery rates accordingly, without the user having to interact, other than inputting grams of carbohydates consumed. You can even view info and control the devices using your iPhone.

Many of you reading, if you don't have first hand experience with Type 1 Diabetes, won't realize what a big deal this is, but it's HUGE. It's also been a major goal of mine in life to help others with diabetes, and now, thanks to this amazing online community of diabetics, I know that I can do that through being a software developer. I am so excited to hopefully be able to work on a project like this in the future.
